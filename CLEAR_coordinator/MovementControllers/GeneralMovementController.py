#This class is a parent class for all dynamic drone movement controllers.
#All drones which have basic movement employ this class. Generic actions are 
#defined here such as moveto, lookat, rotate, stop. These are movement commands
#all drones have the ability to use. However, actions that are also defined in 
#for specifc drones will be called from here. It is
#responsible for triggering the process of sending movement commands to the drone,
#defining basic actions for the drone, and handling all other movement commands.
