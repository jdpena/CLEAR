# PROPORTIONAL_GAIN
#the control output proportionally to the current error.
#So if the error is large, the proportional term will try
#to correct it aggressively. 

# INTEGRAL_GAIN
#This is the sum of all past errors, with each 
#error weighted by the time that has elapsed 
#since it occurred (i.e., it's the integral 
#of the error over time). This term is useful
#for eliminating systematic bias that can't 
#be corrected by the proportional term alone. 
#If the error persists over a long time 
#(even if it's small), the integral term 
#will keep increasing and will push the system 
#to correct the error.

# DERIVATIVE_GAIN 
#This is the rate of change of the error. It 
#predicts the future trend of the error based
#on its current rate of change, providing a
#damping effect and helping to minimize overshooting.
