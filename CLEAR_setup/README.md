CLEAR setup gives you convenient management of your CLEAR project. Setup propagates CLEAR services across your system(s), downloads repositories, and configures appropriate Anaconda environments. Throughout this process, you will be asked to provide project-relevant information such as system locations, credentials, etc. After completing this initial process, you can manage your CLEAR project. With this, you can start and stop the services regardless of their location. Further, you can update the services by either pulling from GitHub or providing a local repository.
 
To use CLEAR setup, run ``./main.sh``.
 
This software has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS and macOS 13.5.2.
